            Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
            I'm gonna give you my heart
            'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
            'Cause you light up the path
            I don't care, go on and tear me apart
            I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
            'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
            I think I saw you
            'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
            I wanna die in your arms, oh, oh-oh
            'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
            I'm gonna give you my heart
